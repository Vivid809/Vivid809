## 🧭 About Me
I’m a data-driven professional specialising in operations, logistics, and supply chain analytics. I build analytical systems that convert raw operational data into actionable insights using Power BI, Python, and cloud-based workflows.

My work focuses on transport performance analysis, forecasting, cost-to-serve modelling, and automation, helping organisations improve efficiency, delivery performance, and data-driven decision-making.

I enjoy solving complex operational problems and creating dashboards, pipelines, and scalable analytics tools that deliver real business value.
