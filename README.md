## Hi there, I'm Mutahher Naseer👋

A Data Scientist based in Brisbane. I build practical AI/analytics solutions across **ML**, **Power BI**, and **AWS**—with a bias for shipped value.

## What I’m focusing on:
- Production-minded ML & data apps
- Portfolio-quality dashboards and AI demos
- Cleaner repos, docs, and CI

## 🔧 What I’m working on currently:

- Building **data-driven decision dashboards** — including a *Cost-to-Serve Logistics Dashboard* in Power BI that analyses delivery routes, driver efficiency, and operational costs to improve profitability.
- Developing **production-ready ML & AI workflows** that connect analytics to automation (e.g., Power BI + Python + AWS pipelines).
- Creating **portfolio-grade dashboards and AI demos** that demonstrate business impact.
- Continuously improving **repo documentation, CI/CD practices, and visual polish** across all public projects.
